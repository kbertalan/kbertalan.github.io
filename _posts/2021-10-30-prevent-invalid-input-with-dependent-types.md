As an application developer I've always wanted to enhance developer experience. The most common tool for this is a statically typed programming language.
It is fascinating what such programming languages can do in compile time, and what amount of issues they can prevent at runtime.
However most of these languages are limited to their own language domains, they require external tools or plugins to extend their capabilities.
In this post I would like to show you a simple problem in the server side web development domain, which can be solved with dependent types in idris programming language.

More to come
